Start-Ups are notoriously difficult to value given inherent subjective factors associated with their creation and promotion.  Nevertheless, there are likely a few key factors that dominate the others and provide for a very rough estimate of the venture at the Series A level.  This calculator can be modified for subsequent capital infusions, but is designed for the base Series A case.  The factors considered are:

1) Founders' Past Experience and Integrity (Character)

2) Revenue (Ratio of Revenue to Invested Capital)

3) Zeitgeist Correlation (Trend Capture)

4) Celebrity Appeal (“Shark Tank Effect”)

Founder's Past Experience is simply measured in years with 20 years as being the maximum relevant timeframe considered.  Revenue is a ratio of current annual revenue and initial funding.
Zeitgeist Correlation is more difficult to define, but corresponds to the relevance of the endeavor to the invisible Zeitgeist (principal component proxy for futuristic relevance and value building).
Celebrity Appeal related to the obvious importance of attracting investors who can attract other investors. 

This is obviously a Beta version and requires considerable refinement.  Thank you for your patience.
